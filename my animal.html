    <h1 style="color: red;">The King of the jungle</h1> 

<p>  

My favorite animal is the  <b>lion</b>. It is known as the <i>king of the jungle</i>, not because it 

is the biggest or the fastest animal, but because of its courage and leadership. The 

lion teaches us an important lesson: <u>you do not have to be the biggest person in programming to suceed. You just need to be brave, keep learning and believe in yourself</u>

 . You just need to be brave, keep learning, and believe in 

yourself. That is how you become a champion in anything you do. Click <a href="lion.html">here</a> to 

see a picture of a lion.
